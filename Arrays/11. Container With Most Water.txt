11. Container With Most Water		(Two Pointer)
You are given an integer array height of length n. There are n vertical lines drawn such that the two endpoints of the ith line are (i, 0) and (i, height[i]).
Find two lines that together with the x-axis form a container, such that the container contains the most water.
Return the maximum amount of water a container can store.



Example 1:
Input: height = [1,8,6,2,5,4,8,3,7]
Output: 49


</>Code
class Solution {
    public int maxArea(int[] height) {
        int maxwater=0;     
        int i=0, j=height.length-1;     //initialize 2 pointers

        while(i<j){
            int w=j-i;      //ca;culate width
            int ht=Math.min(height[i],height[j]);   //calculate height
            int currentwater= w * ht;       //calcute the aree of current bucket

            maxwater = Math.max(maxwater, currentwater);        //compare areas, select the max are

            if(height[i] < height[j]){      //change the border of low height
                i++;    //incremenet i if left border is mall
            }
            else j--;   //decrement j if right border is small

        }
        return maxwater;    //return the max area
    }   
}
